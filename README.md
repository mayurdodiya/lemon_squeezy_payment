4️⃣ What is a Variant?
    In Lemon Squeezy:
    Product = What you're selling (e.g., E-book, Service, Software).
    Variant = Specific pricing option for the product.
    ✔️ Even one-time payments require a variant.
    This is where the default price is defined (but you can override it from your backend using custom_price).

5️⃣ One-Time Payment Flow
    ✔️ How to choose one-time payment:
    When creating a product, select "Digital Product" or "Service".
    Do NOT select Subscription.
    👉 If your product has no subscription period, it is automatically a one-time payment.
